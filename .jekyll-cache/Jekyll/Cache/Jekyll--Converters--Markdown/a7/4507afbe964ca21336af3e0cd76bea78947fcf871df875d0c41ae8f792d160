I"c<p>Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Dipak. This is my blog where I note down the answers for my why questions. I like to observe and appreciate the monopolies of things I encounter - particularly CS and maths stuff and this is where I breakdown my thoughts and own my learning.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a Research Assistant at USC Marshall School of Business and pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Viterbi School of Engineering, <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">USC</a>.</p>

<p>I love solving logical and algorithmic problems, and often participate in programming contests and hackathons for fun!</p>

<p>I have worked for around a year at <a href="https://www.avaya.com/en/">Avaya</a> where I learned a lot from my mentors. I enjoyed my time interning at <a href="https://7targets.ai/">7Targets.ai</a> during the beautiful Summer of 2019 in Pune.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
