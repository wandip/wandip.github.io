Hi 👋, my name is Dipak. This is my blog where I note down the answers for my why questions. I like to observe and appreciate the monopolies of things I encounter - particularly CS and maths stuff and this is where I breakdown my thoughts and own my learning. 

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at USC Marshall School of Business and pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Viterbi School of Engineering, [USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). 

I love solving logical and algorithmic problems, and often participate in programming contests and hackathons for fun!

I have worked for around a year at [Avaya](https://www.avaya.com/en/) where I learned a lot from my mentors. I enjoyed my time interning at [7Targets.ai](https://7targets.ai/) during the beautiful Summer of 2019 in Pune.

Cheers!
