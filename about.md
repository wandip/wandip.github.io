Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Dipak. This is my blog where I note down the answers for my why questions. I like to observe and appreciate the monopolies of things I encounter - particularly nuances around me, things that stick with you and this is where I breakdown my thoughts and own my learning. 

Currently, I am a Data Scientist at IBM. Enjoying my time in the Bay Area under beautiful Californian skies. 

Earlier, during my time in Los Angeles, at USC, I worked a Research Assistant at USC Marshall School of Business and pursued my Master's in Computer Science at [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). 

I love solving logical and algorithmic problems, and often participate in programming contests and hackathons for fun!

I have worked for around a year at [Avaya](https://www.avaya.com/en/) where I learned a lot from my mentors. I enjoyed my time interning at [7Targets.ai](https://7targets.ai/) during the Summer of 2019 in Pune.

Cheers!
